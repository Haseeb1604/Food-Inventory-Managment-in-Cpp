# Food Inventory Management System
Managing the storage of food can be tricky, especially in commercial environments. Fridges and freezers will have many items with “use by”, “frozen on”, etc. This project aims to develop a program that would be useful for both commercial and home users, to keep track of a food inventory.

The program allows the ability to store various kinds of items, and warn users of food that needs to be used in the near future or food that is past it’s suitable date and should be thrown out. You could also think of this as something like a commercial warehouse or distributor, where they may have multiple instances of a food item and should prioritize using the older items first, suggesting the shelf and item with the oldest date on a user's request.
